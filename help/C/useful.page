    <title>Uses</title>

     <p>Phamerator is especially useful for generating and comparing genome maps of multiple phages through the visual interface that displays whole genome nucleotide and protein sequence relationships, as well as the conserved domains within genes.</p>
     <p>Phamerator is useful to provide a representation of how your genome compares with similar genomes.  In particular, if there are substantial disagreements between the auto-annotation and the annotation of closely related genomes, this helps to focus on these and any other areas that require inspection and resolution.  It also provides a genome-wide perspective and thus a context for the annotation refinement, functional analysis, and other explorations to follow.</p>
